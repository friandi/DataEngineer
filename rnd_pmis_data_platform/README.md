# R&D PMIS Data Platform

> **Research & Development (R&D) reference project** for designing an end-to-end **Project Management Information System (PMIS) Data Platform**, focusing on **data engineering best practices**, **clean architecture**, and **enterprise documentation**.

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository demonstrates how to design and structure a **scalable PMIS data platform**, starting from **functional specification (FSD)** and **system design** through to **data pipelines, orchestration, and analytics-ready data models**.

The project is intentionally built as a **generic, client-agnostic reference** suitable for:
- Public GitHub portfolios
- Technical interviews
- Data Engineer / Data Architect showcases
- Enterprise documentation examples (ISO / audit-friendly)

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Provide a **clean, production-grade folder structure** for data engineering projects
- Demonstrate **documentation-first development** (FSD, ERD, System Context)
- Separate **business logic**, **data processing**, and **orchestration**
- Enable future extensions to:
  - Batch & incremental pipelines
  - Data quality validation
  - Analytics & dashboard consumption

---

## 🧱 High-Level Architecture
